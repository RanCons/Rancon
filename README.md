# Rancon
An app that keeps track of your reach of contacts. The user will login through Facebook. He can send cards to people in his friend list who in turn can send them to people in their friend list. Each card will have a purpose, for example a developer is looking for more developers he can join in some work, he can state that in his card and others can respond.The users will also be able to see on a map how far their reach is. They can then contact any person whom they need to, based on their profile. This app can be used for marketing research, and demographic analysis. The user can track where the card has travelled, and also see the clustering on a heat map.
